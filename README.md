Data Science Fundamentals project involving the 2018 Boston Red Sox season using Player Won-Loss Records

# Intro

This project is designed to analyze the 2018 Boston Red Sox season using datasets showing Player Won-Loss Records. Player Won-Loss records are statistics used to measure a baseball player's performance in the context of games. In other words, they help measure how much a certain player contributes to his team winning games, as a modern alternative to traditional pitcher wins and losses. 

Player Won-Loss records were invented by Tom Thress (my dad), and I was very interested in using their data in order to analyze what various factors contribute to a good baseball team. I chose to use these statistics to analyze the 2018 Boston Red Sox because I had recently moved to New England, and I wanted to learn more about the Red Sox history, and the 2018 team is considered one of the best baseball teams of the 2010s in many aspects.

There were several questions that I decided to look into using these datasets. Firstly, I wanted to identify the key players that contributed to the team's success in 2018. Next, I wanted to compare the Red Sox to the entire American League in 2018 and identify what particular aspects that they were good at. Finally, I wanted to compare them to the team that they beat in the World Series that year, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and identify approximately how much better the Red Sox were than the Dodgers.

All datasets were taken from www.baseball.tomthress.com


# Methods

For Parts 1 and 2, I first imported the data as a dataframe using Pandas. Then, I sorted the data based on key statistics that I wanted to highlight, and used MatPlotLib to create charts for those statistics.

For Part 3, I imported the data as a dataframe using Pandas, and split it up into two dataframes: one for the Red Sox, and one for the Dodgers. Then, I summed up the key statistics that I was looking at and used a formula to calculate the win probability for the Red Sox over the Dodgers
